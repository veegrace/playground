// GENERATED:
// The Pipeline patter is a powerful design pattern that allows you to create a series of stages that process data.
// Each stage is a self-contained unit that can process data and pass it to the next stage.
// This pattern is useful when you have a series of tasks that need to be performed on a piece of data.
// Each stage can be run concurrently, which can help improve the performance of your application.
// In this snippet, we have a pipeline that processes images.
// The loadImage function reads an image from a file and
// creates a job struct that contains the image and the path to the output file.
//
// The resize function resizes the image, and
// the convertToGrayscale function converts the image to grayscale.
// The saveImage function saves the image to a file.
// Each function takes an input channel and returns an output channel.
// This allows you to chain the functions together to create a pipeline.
// The main function creates a pipeline that reads an image,
// resizes it, converts it to grayscale, and saves it to a file.
// The pipeline is created by chaining the functions together using the <- operator.
// The main function then reads the final output channel and waits for the pipeline to complete.
// The Pipeline pattern is a powerful tool that can help you create efficient and scalable applications.
// It allows you to break down complex tasks into smaller, more manageable units that can be run concurrently.

// Pipeline Pattern is powerful design used in concurrent programming particularly in go with its goroutines and channels
// It allows you to setup a series of processing stages where the output of one stage is the input of the next stage.
// This pattern is beneficial for processing data streams especially when the processing can be broken done
// into a distinct independent steps.
//
// Build an imgae processing pipeline:
// LoadImgae -> Compress -> Grayscale -> Write to a file
//
// -> (represent a channel)
