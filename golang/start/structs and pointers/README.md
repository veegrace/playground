# Structs

A struct groups related variables into a single entity.

Additionally, structs can have methods, similar to classes in C++ or Java.

Unlike classes in C++ or Java, structs donâ€™t implement inheritance. You can achieve some of the code re-use with struct embedding.

Zero value of a struct is a struct whose fields are set to their respective zero values.
